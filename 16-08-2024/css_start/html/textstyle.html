      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense in 1962 (cover dated
      March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man in 1968. Shortly
      after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero
      team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man
      stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published
      consistently since the character's creation.

    <h3>Publication history</h3>

    <p>
      Larry Lieber developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the first Iron Man
      story, while Jack Kirby and Don Heck were responsible for the initial
      design.Lee modeled Iron Man after businessman Howard Hughes,
      invoking his physical appearance, his image as a businessman, and his
      reputation as an arrogant playboy.Kirby and Heck then incorporated
      elements of the actor Errol Flynn's physical appearance in the design.
      When first designing the character, Lee wanted to create a modernized
      Arthurian knight. Kirby initially drew the Iron Man armor as a "round
      and clunky gray heap", and Heck modified the design to incorporate gadgets
      such as jets, drills, and suction cups. The Iron Man character was
      created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted
      struggling with real-life problems, and his heart injury was an early
      example of a superhero with a physical disability.
